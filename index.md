# Hello!
We're the Wicker System.  
<br /><br />

### Who are we?
We're probably a traumagenic system. You can find more information 
about specific headmates on [our pages](./headmates/)!
<br /><br />

### What are we doing?
You can find out what we're doing at [our twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thewickersys)
most often, but we are trying to start a [blog](./blog).
<br /><br />

### What did you just say?
Some explaination on what we say can be found [here](./system-wide-pages)
<br /><br />

### [Reminders](./system-reminders)
