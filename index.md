# Hello!
We're the Wicker System.  
  

### Who are we?
We're probably a traumagenic system. You can find more information 
about specific headmates on [our pages](https://tanyalebean.github.io/headmates/)!

### What are we doing?
You can find out what we're doing at [our twitter](https://www.twitter.com/thewickersys)
most often, but we are trying to start a [blog](https://tanyalebean.github.io/blog).

##### Testing site
